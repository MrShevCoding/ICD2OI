# ICD2OI #
This repo is all of my grade 10 computer science course (including lessons and my work, but I will explain later because apperntly we won't be programming as much), started this course in semester 2 at February 2nd 2026, will say my thoughts later but currently undergoing this course! Mainly the course is called **Digital Technology and Innovations in the Changing World** This is composed of 8 units, with sometimes us doing programming (our language being python) and learning about tech today (like disassembling a pc and learn about those components). There will be etheir a prompt and an explanation with .md that follows and/or the program I did with .py 
- This mainly to help organize my items and thoughts about this class (if anyone is curious about the grade 10 CS class in highschool, here is a little sneek peek of it!)


# Course Description on MyBlueprint
This course helps students develop cutting-edge digital technology and computer programming skills that will support them in contributing to and leading the global economic, scientific and societal innovations of tomorrow. Students will learn and apply coding concepts and skills to build hands-on projects and investigate artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and other emerging digital technologies that connect to a wide range of fields and careers. Using critical thinking skills with a focus on digital citizenship, students will investigate the appropriate use and development of the digital technologies that they encounter every day, as well as the benefits and limitations of these technologies.

Will update this later on after I finish but super hyped for this course
