### Game name - King of the Hill! 
- The goal of the game is to try to get as many points as possible by the end of the game
You gain points by banking out your pieces and using abilities to stop your opponent from banking out


## How it works:
- There are 2 players, player A and player B, each player has 2 moves per turn (you can repeat the same move twice), choose between 3 actions:
  - Place a piece of your own (x or o) on one tile 
  - Use a powerup
  - Bank out tile(s)
    - If you bank out a 1 singular tile, you receive 1 point
    - If you bank out 2 tiles in a row, you receive 3 points
    - If you bank out 3 tiles in a row, you receive 6 points
  - After the player’s 2 turns, the player shall roll a d6 die to decide your powerup
    - Roll a 1 or 2, you get swap. Swap 2 tiles anywhere on the map
    - Roll a 3 or 4, you get push. Push a row or column in whatever direction you want. Pushes all pieces in that direction. 
      - If any piece (being the player pieces or deadspace) gets pushed of the depot area, it gets deleted
    - Roll a 5, you get bomb. Blow up a 2x2 area anywhere board, getting rid of all pieces in that 2x2 area.
    - Roll a 6, you get deadspace, which you can use to leave a black square that blocks an empty tile. Players are not allowed to place their piece on the dead space but however their allowed to swap, push and blow the deadspace up

## Round system:
- At the start of the game, you roll a dice (for this you can pick whatever dice works for you, less sides = shorter games, more sides = longer games), add 5 to that number, that’s the number of rounds you will be playing. We recommend to use a d6 dice for shorter games, and a d20 for longer games.
- At the end of the rounds, all the remaining pieces on the hill area specifically bank out and the rest of the points are awarded.

  - The board is a consisted of 2 parts, a 3x3 (called the Hill) with extended 2x3 areas on each side (called the Depo), you can only bank out tiles in the hill area, you can not bank out player tiles in the Depo area


## Different Stratedgies:
These are some stradgies we believe some players would be doing, some include


1. The Scardey Cat
- Core Philosophy: "Secure steady points, minimize as much as risk as possible."

- Strategy: Focuses on quick, small bank-outs (1-2 tiles) as soon as possible. Treats the Hill area as a point farm, not a battlefield to conquest. They prioritize banking over board control and use power-ups defensively to protect their imminent scores rather than make big plays to risk for biger points. Their goal is to build a consistent, unassailable lead early.

- Win Condition: Wins by incremental gains, often hoping the opponent's ambitious combos fail later on the game.


2. The Combo Wombo Guy
- Core Philosophy: "Go big or go home."

- Strategy: Patiently builds towards position that have high-value 3-in-a-row banks (6 points). They will sacrifice early banking opportunities to set up their perfect formation. Their power-ups are used selfishly to assemble their own lines (Swaps to fill gaps, Pushes to align). Vulnerable to disruption but scores in big bursts.

- Win Condition: Wins by landing one or two "megabanks" that change their scoring in the game.


3. The Warloard of the Battlefield(Aggressive Disruptor)
- Core Philosophy: "The best defense is a good offense."

- Strategy: Believes points come from denying the opponent getting their points. They use every power-up and placement as a weapon. Pushes opponent pieces off the map, Bombs their formations, Swaps to steal key tiles. Their own banking is secondary, opportunistic, and often reactive.


- Win Condition: Wins by creating chaos, keeping the opponent's score low, and banking the wreckage.


4. The Controller (Defensive Denier)
- Core Philosophy: "Control the middle, control the game."

- Strategy: Focuses everything on board state over getting immediate points. Uses Deadspace as much as posible to block key squares places, places pieces to prevent opponent lines, and uses Pushes/Swaps primarily to break up threats. They aim to make the Hill a fortress of sorts that only they can score on, then bank at their leisure. They basically want to make the opponent struggle and not have fun.

- Win Condition: Wins by limting the opponent's options and securing the Hill in the endgame.


5. The Gambler (Power-Up Synergist)
- Core Philosophy: "Screw it I can’t win with my brain I shal win with luck."

- Strategy: They don’t have a fixed plan. Instead, they heavily rely on improvisation and power-up combos. They see the board purely through the lens of their current roll. A "Push" becomes an opportunity to set up a theft, a "Bomb" is a chance to clear space for a future move. Highly unpredictable and adaptive, but they lack a long-term goal and instead let luck be all on their side.

- Win Condition: Wins by maximizing the value of every random power-up roll, outmaneuvering other people’s rigid plans.


6. The Engineer (Setup Player)
- Core Philosophy: "Set up the dominoes, and watch the show of knocking them down."


- Strategy: Operates on a 2-turn plan cycle. Turn 1 is always setup (place a piece somewhere, use Deadspace as a future projectile, Push to create a vulnerable line for the opponent). Turn 2 is the execution phase where they try to makimize the pain of other players (Swap the prepared piece in, Push the Deadspace into the Hill, bank the "trapped" opponent line). They think one step ahead of the current board.

- Win Condition: Wins by trying to execute the clever, premeditated combos that are hard to see coming.

7. The Scavenger (Reactive Opportunist)
- Core Philosophy: "Profit from mistakes of other people and leftovers of the field."

- Strategy: A hybrid of the both Scardey cat and Warlord. They rarely build their own combos from scratch. Instead, they constantly pressure the opponent, force them into sub-optimal places, and then swoop in to claim the remaining valuable tiles or bank out the damaged formations their opponent leaves behind. Excellent at turning a defensive move into a point gain at any given moment.

- Win Condition: Wins by having a higher point-per-action efficiency, capitalizing on every skirmish with the other player.


8. The Endgame Rusher
- Core Philosophy: "The final few rounds are the only ones that matter."

- Strategy: Plays a quiet, non-confrontational early/mid-game, only focusing on piece preservation and clogging the Depot area. They track the round count very carefully. In the final 3-4 rounds, they unleash all saved power-ups and actions in a furious scoring and disruption, knowing full well their opponent won't have time to recover. Their strength is timing and having a game-length awareness.


- Win Condition: Wins by stealing the game in the final moments, overwhelming the other opponent who isn't pacing correctly for the end.
