Based on what you watched or read, in 75-150 words, explain to your Grade 7 brother what cloud storage is.

| Hey lil bro,  do you know a thing called “cloud storage”,  Imagine you have too much homework or notes or objects or items at your home, and instead you need ALL OF THAT somewhere else, and you don’t have the hands for it. Well, cloud storage is basically like having a safe (well, it depends on the provider and service; don't worry, I won't go super detail into that lil bro), a HUGE storage unit that you can use anywhere in town where you can send the stuff I said above that you aren't using currently into there, and a cloud provider (aka the handydany man who lets you use it’s provider) that brings them back to you (well the speed is different based on your internet and provider and blah blah blah)to you onto your device that you want to access with. It’s super good trust me\!

**Topic 2:  Find 2 videos or websites that explain the difference between an HDD and an SSD.**

Based on what you read, in 75-150 words, explain to your Grade 6 sister what the difference is.

| Hey sis, just asking but do you know the difference between HDD and SSD? Well let it’s basically the way your computer stores data in the first place\! Their are 2 main options which are HDD and SSD. Think of your computer storage like a toy box filled with toys of your choice. An HDD (Hard Disk Drive) is like a slow toy box with a spinning record player inside, which can take some time to find things you are searching for. An SSD (Solid State Drive) however is like a magic folder with no moving parts in it, it can find your toys instantly (well depends on your SSD speed and everything but basically it's SUPER fast compared to HDD), which helps make your computers super fast, quiet, and built to last for years to come while also being REALLY small [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkhBG4Ny77g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkhBG4Ny77g)  [https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-ssd-hard-drive/](https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-ssd-hard-drive/)  |
