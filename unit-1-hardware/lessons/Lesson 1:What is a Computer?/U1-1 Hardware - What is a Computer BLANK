# Lesson 1 What is a computer? #

Learning goals
- Determine what makes a good definition
- Decided what devices are considered computers
- Design a definition for a computer

Defining a category

Defining what something is can be deceivingly difficult. For example:

What is a vehicle?
Maybe we say “An object with 4 wheels”

Assuming this is correct, fill in the table below with some examples

This definition includes
This definition does not include
Office chair
A single roller skate
Shopping cart
Car
Sliding door


Planes
Trains
Helicopters
Tanks
Boats
A ham sandwich




…okay maybe that wasn’t such a good definition.


Okay, you do better!

A vehicle is… a man made form of carrier transportation method that is used to carry living being(s) or/and tangible object(s) over short or/and long distance, usually consiting of being motorized  

What makes a good definition?

Correct inclusion of the items in the defination:

Must be general enough to include everything in the category


Correct exclusion inclusion of the items in the defination:

Must be specific enough to exclude everything not in the category


Timelessness:

Definition should work at any point in time (won’t become outdated)

Class definition of a computer
Now, work through the attached slideshow to come up with a definition of a computer. After we discuss as a class, copy down our definition here:


An eletronic man-made (artificial) device(s) that can compute data, that can etheir input data, store data, change and process data (aka compute), and output data actively.
