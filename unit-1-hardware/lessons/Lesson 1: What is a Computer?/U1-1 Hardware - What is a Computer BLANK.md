# **Lesson 1 What is a computer?** #

## Learning goals 
- Determine what makes a good definition
- Decided what devices are considered computers
- Design a definition for a computer

## Defining a category
Defining what something is can be deceivingly difficult. For example:
- What is a vehicle?
  - Maybe we say “An object with 4 wheels”

Assuming this is correct, fill in the table below with some examples

- This definition includes
  - This definition does not include
  - Office chair
  - A single roller skate
  - Shopping cart
  - A Car
  - Sliding door


- This definition doesn't includes
  - Planes
  - Trains
  - Helicopters
  - Tanks
  - Boats
  - A fried chicken sandwich

…okay maybe that wasn’t such a good definition.


- Okay, you do better!

  - A vehicle is… a man made form of carrier transportation method that is used to carry living being(s) or/and tangible object(s) over short or/and long distance, usually consiting of being motorized  

## What makes a good definition?

1. Correct *inclusion* of the items in the defination:

- Must be general enough to include everything in the category

2. Correct *exclusion* of the items in the defination:

- Must be specific enough to exclude everything not in the category

3. Timelessness:

- Definition *should work at any point in time* (won’t become outdated)

## Class definition of a computer
Now, work through the attached slideshow to come up with a definition of a computer. After we discuss as a class, copy down our definition here:

- An eletronic man-made (artificial) device(s) that can compute data, that can etheir input data, store data, change and process data (aka compute), and output data actively.
